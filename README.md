# Is it real?

## Introduction
**Is it real?** is a scam detection tool that helps users check if online messages, links, or screenshots might be scams. Online scams are increasing, and many people — especially youth, newcomers, and seniors — struggle to know what is safe. Our tool analyzes user input, explains risks clearly, highlights red flags, and suggests safe next steps.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React  
- **AI Processing:** Gemini AI  
- **Hosting / Deployment:** Vercel

## How It Works
1. User enters messages, links, notes, or uploads an image.
2. The input is sent securely to the AI system.
3. The AI analyzes scam indicators.
4. The system returns:
   - Risk level
   - Confidence score
   - Red flags
   - Recommended next steps


## For Developers
- Make sure to create a .env.local with the GEMINI API key in the same folder as the package.json to ensure the project works.

## Challenges
Connecting Gemini AI to our React application was difficult at first. We had to figure out how to properly send and receive data between the frontend and AI system, but we solved it through testing and debugging.
